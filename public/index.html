                React Quiz tests your knowledge on React - a JavaScript
                framework from Facebook. It also helps you to learn answers to
                some common questions asked in interviews. In all, it is a fun
                way to enhance your React knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three sections: React, React Native and JavaScript.
                There are plans to add a few more sections: CSS, Redux, Webpack,
                etc. Basically, one stop place to test your knowledge as a React
                developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I keep updating the questions. Old questions are automatically
                deleted. New questions are added from time to time. Whenever new
                questions are added, I send a push notification using Firebase
                console.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app was built using React Native. The entire source code is
                available in
                <a href="https://github.com/vijayst/react-quiz">GitHub</a>. All
                questions and answers are available in the repository (quizzes
                folder) if you want to take a look at it there.
            </p>
